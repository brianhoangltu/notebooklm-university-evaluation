2. **Research Literature Summary** – using eight ERP adoption and digital transformation papers.

## Folder Structure
- `/logs` – Markdown files recording prompts, model responses, and reflections.  
- `/screenshots` – Visual evidence (PNG images) showing each NotebookLM feature.  

## Summary of Findings
NotebookLM provided accurate, source-grounded summaries and effective multimodal study aids.  
Limitations included minor paraphrasing errors, source bias, and occasional over-summarisation.  
See `/logs` for detailed run notes.
